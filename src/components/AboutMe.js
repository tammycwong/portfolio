      I first started coding when I was 15, personalizing my layouts for my blog platforms- Xanga and LiveJournal. <br/>
      I loved changing themes to my site through custom banners, mp3s and dynamic styling with JavaScript and CSS. <br/>
      I love to build fun and very mildly (but sometimes moderately) marketable projects.<br/>
