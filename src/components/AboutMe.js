      <p>
    I love creating applications that are fun and users can benefit from.<br/>
    I first started coding when I was 15, personalizing my layouts for my blog platforms- Xanga and LiveJournal. <br/>
    I loved changing themes to my site through custom banners, mp3s and dynamic styling with JavaScript and CSS. </p>
    </div>
