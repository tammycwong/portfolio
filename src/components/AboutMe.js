      A career changer from hospitality management to tech.<br/>
      I have a serious passion for creating fun yet beneficial applications;<br/>
      The most exhilarating journey is building an engaging user experience and learning the best way to do so.<br/>
      {/* One of my strengths is frontend engineering as well as conceptual thinking. <br/> */}
      <br/>
      I first started coding when I was 15, personalizing my layouts for my blog platforms- Xanga and LiveJournal. <br/>
      I loved changing themes to my site through custom banners, mp3s and dynamic styling with JavaScript and CSS. <br/>
      Each layout taylored to my current mood as an angsty teen.<br/>
      <br/>
      My background in cognitive and behaviorial psychology has helped me understand the human mind and how it works with user experience design.<br/>
